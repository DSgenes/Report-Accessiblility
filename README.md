# Report-Accessiblility

# Overview :

• Enhance the accessibility of the visuals using descriptive titles, markers, alt text, and accessible coloring.

• Improve the accessibility of the overall report by changing the tab order and using themes.

• Discuss the improvements made to the report, outlining their benefit for users with disabilities.

# Case Study : 

  Adventure Works recently welcomed new members to its sales team, including Logan, who is visually impaired. Committed to inclusivity, the directors have asked the data analytics team to 
  ensure all reports are accessible, aiming to make them 
  more user-friendly for a wider audience. You are assigned the task of incorporating accessibility features to enhance and refine an existing report that contains sales data for the months 
  of February, March, and April across various sales 
  regions, aligning with the best practices you have learned.

# Step 1: Open the report in Power BI Desktop.

      • Download and open the "Creating an Accessible Report" file in Power BI Desktop.

  This step gives you access to the current structure and contents of the report, enabling you to determine where necessary improvements to accessibility need to be made.

# Step 2: Add a meaningful report title

  Provide a clear, concise title to give context and help all users, including those with disabilities, understand the report’s focus.

      • To add the title, select the report title and update it to "Adventure Works Quarterly Regional Sales Report."
