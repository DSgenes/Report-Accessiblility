# Report-Accessiblility

# Overview :

• Enhance the accessibility of the visuals using descriptive titles, markers, alt text, and accessible coloring.

• Improve the accessibility of the overall report by changing the tab order and using themes.

• Discuss the improvements made to the report, outlining their benefit for users with disabilities.

# Case Study : 

Adventure Works recently welcomed new members to its sales team, including Logan, who is visually impaired. Committed to inclusivity, the directors have asked the data analytics team to ensure all reports are accessible, aiming to make them 
more user-friendly for a wider audience. You are assigned the task of incorporating accessibility features to enhance and refine an existing report that contains sales data for the months of February, March, and April across various sales 
regions, aligning with the best practices you have learned.

This step gives you access to the current structure and contents of the report, enabling you to determine where necessary improvements to accessibility need to be made.
